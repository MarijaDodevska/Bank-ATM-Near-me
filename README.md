Mapping and navigation based applications have long outgrown the scope of traditional Google/Apple Maps.
If you think about it, it's hard to find an app that doesn't use geolocation. From apps like Find My iPhone or Weather, to Instagram, Uber or Yelp. Most instant messaging apps offer the ability to share your location directly in the chat. Even the photos in your smartphone are neatly organized by location and date they were taken.

Many times we have come to a situation where we have to urgently make a payment in the nearest bank or withdraw money from the nearest ATM (because of the lower commission, we usually choose the ATM of the bank where our bank account is also located). We need a simple navigation system to the nearest branch and ATM of the same bank, using the most optimal route. The optimality of the route is determined according to the requirements and circumstances of the user.

After selecting the route, the system displays the distance and the estimated arrival time to the branch.
